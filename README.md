This is the backend part of my MERN project.
I wrote it in expressjs, made API's for listening requests like signup,login, adding items in cart, removing items from cart, changing quantity of particular item, adding address and placing the order. All the data is being stored in mongoDB database.
It still has to do so many improvements and will do it.
